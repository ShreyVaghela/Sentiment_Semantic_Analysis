# Sentiment_Semantic_Analysis
The project extracts the data from Twitter and NEWS API to perform the semantic and sentiment analysis. It performs the sentiment analysis on Twitter data at `Twitter/cleaned_twitter_data` and semantic analysis on NEWS data at `News/News Articles`. The Twitter data was extracted with the help of [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/getting_started.html). The NEWS API was extracted using [NEWS API](https://newsapi.org/). This project was developed towards the fulfillment of the course CSCI 5408 - Data Management, Warehousing and Analytics.  The `Report.pdf` contains the summary of the project.

### Sentiment Analysis
The `Twitter` folder contains scripts like `cleaning_twitter_data.py`, `twitter_data.py`,  etc., which helps to extract data using the API and pre-process it. For the pre-processing, it removes any metadata, URLs, and special characters. The `polarity_twitter_data.py` counts the number of positive and negative words in order to find the polarity of the tweets. It performs it by converting the tweets into bag-of-words and comparing them with the list of positive and negative words. The below figure shows the visualization of word-cloud for positive and negative words occuring in the tweets using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).

### Semantic Analysis
The `News` folder contains scripts like `cleaning_news_data.py`, `news_data.py`,  etc., which helps to extract data using the API and cleans the data by removing any URLs. The `Semantic_Analysis.py` converts news data from `cleaned_news_data.csv` and stores into different files at `News/News Articles`. Then, it finds TF-IDF and number of occurrences of word `Canada` in documents. It then counts the total words in a document and calculates relative frequency. The `relative_frequency.csv` contains the information about frequency and relative frequency of word `Canada` in every documents it occurs. At last, the script prints the article which has the highest relative frequency as shown in below figure.
